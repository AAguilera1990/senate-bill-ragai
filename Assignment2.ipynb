The \\ndeduction is limited to 20 percent of taxable income minus net capital gain. \\n \\nSpecial rules apply to taxpayers with taxable income in excess of the “threshold amount,” which, \\nfor tax year 2025, is $394,600 for married taxpayers ﬁling jointly and $197,300 for all other \\ntaxpayers. The threshold amount is indexed annually for inﬂation. For taxpayers with taxable \\nincome in excess of the threshold amount, the deduction for qualiﬁed business income is \\nlimited based on (1) the W-2 wages and capital investment of each relevant business (the “wage \\nand investment limitation”), and (2) whether each relevant business is a speciﬁed service trade \\nor business (the “SSTB limitation”). Both limitations phase in over a ﬁxed range of taxable \\nincome ($100,000 for married taxpayers ﬁling jointly and $50,000 for all other taxpayers). Due \\nto the structure of these phase-ins, some taxpayers are subject to marginal tax rates close to 70 \\npercent. \\n \\nThe deduction for qualiﬁed business income is set to expire for taxable years beginning after \\nDecember 31, 2025. \\n \\nProvision: This provision makes the deduction for qualiﬁed business income permanent.

Under this provision, instead of phasing in over a ﬁxed range of taxable income, \\nthese limitations phase in at a ﬁxed rate. Speciﬁcally, for each dollar of taxable income over the \\nthreshold amount, a taxpayer’s deduction for qualiﬁed business income is reduced by 75 cents \\nuntil both limitations are fully phased in. This change prevents taxpayers from being subject to \\nmarginal tax rates close to 70 percent. \\n \\nAdditionally, this provision modiﬁes the calculation of the threshold amount by adding an \\nadditional year of inﬂation adjustment. \\n \\nThis provision also makes certain income of business development companies (as deﬁned in the \\nInvestment Company Act of 1940) eligible for the qualiﬁed business income deduction. \\n \\nSec. 110006.

A taxpayer subject to the Pease limitation \\nis generally required to reduce itemized deductions by three percent of the amount by which \\nthe taxpayer’s adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable income threshold. \\n  \\nAdditionally, the value of a taxpayer’s itemized deductions depends on the taxpayer’s marginal \\nincome tax rate.

Additionally, section 45F is further strengthened for small businesses by increasing the \\nmaximum credit to $600,000 and the percent of qualiﬁed child care expenses covered to 50 \\npercent. Therefore, a small business must spend at least $1.2 million on child care related \\nexpenses to receive the full credit. An eligible small business is one that meets the gross \\nreceipts test under Internal Revenue Code section 448(c) for a ﬁve-year period. \\n \\nAdditionally, this provision allows for small businesses to pool their resources to provide child \\ncare to their employees and for businesses to use a third-party intermediary to facilitate child \\ncare services on their behalf.'),\n",

A child is considered to be special needs \\nif they are diﬃcult to place in a home (i.e. are older, have a disability or health condition, or are \\npart of a sibling group). When a child is deemed special needs by a state government, the \\nadoptive family becomes eligible for the full adoption tax credit.  \\n \\nProvision: This provision provides parity to Indian tribal governments, giving them the same \\nability as state governments to determine whether a child has special needs for the purposes of \\nthe adoption tax credit. \\n \\nSec. 110109.

A “motor vehicle” means a motor vehicle that is: (1) any self-\\npropelled vehicle designed for transporting person or property on a public street, highway, or \\nroad; (2) a boat; or (3) farm machinery or equipment. \\n \\nProvision: This provision increases the cap on the deductibility of business interest expense for \\ntaxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030.

Special depreciation allowance for qualiﬁed production property. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, taxpayers are generally required to deduct the cost of \\nnonresidential real property over a 39-year period. \\n \\nProvision: This provision allows taxpayers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of \\ncertain new factories, certain improvements to existing factories, and certain other structures. \\n \\nSpeciﬁcally, this provision allows taxpayers to deduct 100 percent of the adjusted basis of \\nqualiﬁed production property in the year such property is placed in service. “Qualiﬁed \\nproduction property” is deﬁned as the portion of any nonresidential real property that meets \\nthe following requirements (among others): \\n1. The property must be used by the taxpayer as an integral part of a qualiﬁed production \\nactivity; \\n2. The property must be placed in service in the U.S. or a U.S. territory; \\n3. The original use of the property must begin with the taxpayer; \\n4. The construction of the property must begin after December 31, 2024, and before \\nJanuary 1, 2030; \\n5.

Renewal and enhancement of opportunity zones. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, opportunity zones (OZs) exist as a temporary policy that have \\nbeen used as an economic development tool to revitalize distressed communities across the \\ncountry. Created in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, OZs are census tracts that meet the deﬁnition of \\n“low-income community” and that were nominated by state governors and certiﬁed by the U.S. \\nDepartment of Treasury as eligible areas for qualiﬁed investments to be made in exchange for \\ncertain tax beneﬁts. The program was created as temporary policy, existing over a 10-year \\nwindow as an initial “round” of OZ development. \\n \\nDeﬁnitions \\nLow-Income Community (LIC): A census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a \\nmedian family income that does not exceed 80 percent of the area median income.  \\n \\nQualiﬁed Opportunity Fund (QOF): An investment vehicle with the speciﬁc purpose of investing \\nin OZs.

For investments held for at least 10 years, taxpayers receive a permanent exclusion of \\ntaxable income on the gains resulting from the original investment.  \\n \\nThe initial OZ round is set to expire after December 31, 2026.  \\n \\nProvision: This provision creates a second round of OZs, making adjustments and improvements \\nto the previous policy. Speciﬁcally, the deﬁnition of “low-income community” is narrowed to \\ncensus tracts that have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income that \\ndoes not exceed 70 percent of the area median income. Additionally, a guardrail is added to \\nensure that the term “low-income community” does not include any census tract where the \\nmedian family income is 125 percent or greater of the area median family income.  \\n \\nThis provision maintains the OZ designation process from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and adds \\nthat at least 33 percent of designated OZs must be comprised entirely of a rural area. In the case \\nthat there are fewer than 33 percent of rural qualiﬁed OZs, all eligible rural areas must be \\ndesignated. A rural area is deﬁned in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. \\nAdditionally, this provision makes contiguous tracts ineligible for OZ designation.  \\n \\nFurthermore, this provision simpliﬁes the investment incentives and creates “rural qualiﬁed \\nopportunity funds” (RQOFs). Investments made in a QOF receive a single step-up in basis of 10 \\npercent when held for at least ﬁve years. In rural areas, investments must be made into a RQOF \\nand will receive a 30 percent step-up in basis when held for at least ﬁve years. Additionally, \\ntaxpayers may choose to invest up to $10,000 of post-tax ordinary income into a QOF or RQOF, \\nand a special rule is created that lowers the “substantial improvement” threshold of existing \\nstructures from 100 percent to 50 percent in rural areas.  \\n \\nLastly, this provision adds reporting requirements for the OZ program.  \\n \\nThis second round of OZs will begin on January 1, 2027, and end on December 31, 2033.  \\nSec. 111103.

The $1 million \\namount is reduced by the amount by which the cost of such property placed in service during \\nthe taxable year exceeds $2.5 million. The $1 million and $2.5 million amounts are adjusted for \\ninﬂation for taxable years beginning after 2018, and are $1.25 million and $3.13 million in 2025, \\nrespectively.

A third-party settlement organization is the central organization \\nthat has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees (generally, a \\nmerchant or business) in a third-party payment network. The change in reporting thresholds \\nwas supposed to take eﬀect following the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARPA). However, due \\nto delays in implementation, for the 2024 tax year, third-party settlement organizations must \\nissue a Form 1099-K for payees receiving gross payments exceeding $5,000 for goods or \\nservices, regardless of the number of transactions. This threshold decreases to $2,500 for 2025 \\nand is set to drop to $600 for 2026 and beyond, as originally mandated by ARPA, though the IRS \\nhas repeatedly delayed full implementation. \\n \\nProvision: This provision modiﬁes requirements for third-party settlement organizations to \\neliminate their reporting requirement with respect to the transactions of their participating \\npayees unless they have earned more than $20,000 on more than 200 separate transactions in \\nan applicable tax period. This reverses the ARPA provision that lowered the reporting threshold \\nto $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions. \\n \\nSec. 111105. Increase in threshold for requiring information reporting with respect to certain \\npayees. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, the reporting threshold for payments by a business for services \\nperformed by an independent contractor or subcontractor and for certain other payments is \\ngenerally $600. In some cases, the reporting threshold is based on payments made during the \\ntaxable year. \\nProvision: This provision generally increases the threshold to $2,000 and adjusts it for inﬂation \\nfor taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024.

Speciﬁcally, it would make qualiﬁed sound recording productions placed in \\nservice before January 1, 2029, eligible for expensing under IRC section 168(k). It would also \\nallow taxpayers to expense up to $150,000 (per taxable year) of costs of qualiﬁed sound \\nrecording productions under IRC section 181.

Limitation on individual deductions for certain State and local taxes, etc. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, in the case of an individual, the itemized deduction for state \\nand local taxes is capped at $10,000 ($5,000 for a married taxpayer ﬁling a separate return) (the \\n“SALT cap”). In general, income taxes paid or accrued in carrying on a trade or business or an \\nincome-producing activity are subject to the SALT cap. The SALT cap is set to expire for taxable \\nyears beginning after December 31, 2025. \\n \\nProvision: This provision would increase the SALT cap to $30,000 ($15,000 for a married \\ntaxpayer ﬁling a separate return). In the case of a taxpayer with modiﬁed adjusted gross income \\n(MAGI) over $400,000 ($200,000 for a married taxpayer ﬁling a separate return), the cap would \\nphase down by 20 percent of the excess of MAGI over the threshold until it reaches $10,000 \\n($5,000 for a married taxpayer ﬁling a separate return). This provision would extend the SALT \\ncap permanently for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. \\n \\nThis provision also includes several changes to prevent the avoidance of the SALT cap. Generally, \\nthis provision clariﬁes and modiﬁes the list of taxes subject to the SALT cap (\"speciﬁed taxes”); \\nprovides that certain payments that substitute for speciﬁed taxes are also subject to the SALT \\ncap; requires partnerships and S corporations to treat speciﬁed taxes as separately stated items; \\nimposes an addition to tax in certain cases where a partnership makes a state or local tax \\npayment, one or more partners receives a state or local tax beneﬁt, and the allocation of the tax \\npayment diﬀers from the allocation of the tax beneﬁt; prevents the capitalization of speciﬁed \\ntaxes; and grants the Secretary of the Treasury regulatory authority to prevent avoidance of the \\nSALT cap. \\n \\nSec. 112019. Excessive employee renumeration from controlled group members and \\nallocation of deduction. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, publicly held corporations are denied a tax deduction for \\ncompensation paid to certain covered employees (typically the CEO, CFO, and the next three \\nhighest-paid oﬃcers) exceeding $1 million per year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expanded the \\nscope by eliminating the performance-based compensation exception and including more \\nentities, like certain publicly traded partnerships, as covered corporations. The limitation applies \\nto taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. ARPA expanded the deﬁnition of \"covered \\nemployees\" to include the ﬁve highest-compensated employees beyond the CEO, CFO, and \\nthree highest-paid oﬃcers, eﬀective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2026. Unlike the \\noriginal covered employees, these additional ﬁve are not subject to the \"once covered, always \\ncovered\" rule and are determined annually based on deductible compensation. \\n \\nProvision: This provision applies aggregation rules for the purposes of the deduction limitation \\nand allocation of deduction applied under IRC section 162(m) as it relates to certain excessive \\nemployee remuneration. \\n \\nSec. 112020.

The AOTC \\nand/or LLC cannot be claimed if the TIN is issued after the due date of the return (including \\nextensions). \\n \\nProvision: This provision adds requirements for the student and taxpayer (if ﬁling on behalf of \\nthe student) to include their SSN on their tax return in order to receive either the AOTC or LLC \\nunder IRC section 25A. \\n \\nPart 3 – Preventing Fraud, Waste, and Abuse \\n \\nSec. 112201. Requiring Exchange veriﬁcation of eligibility for health plan. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, Exchanges take steps to verify applicants’ eligibility for \\ncoverage and premium tax credits. However, in some circumstances applicants may be passively \\nre-enrolled in coverage (and receive premium tax credits) without updating veriﬁcation. \\nProvision: This provision prohibits an individual from claiming the premium tax credit if the \\nindividual’s eligibility related to income, enrollment, and other requirements is not actively \\nveriﬁed annually. \\n  \\nSec. 112202. Disallowing premium tax credit in case of certain coverage enrolled in during \\nspecial enrollment period. \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has \\nprovided for a continuous special enrollment period available to individuals with a projected \\nannual household income no greater than 150 percent of the federal poverty line. \\n  \\nProvision: This provision prohibits individuals from receiving premium tax credits if they enroll in \\nhealth coverage on the Exchange through a special enrollment period associated with their \\nincome.'),\n",

One such penalty is based on aiding and abetting the understatement \\nof tax liability, if the person knows that an understatement of the tax liability of another person \\nwould result. Separately, paid tax return preparers are subject to a penalty of $500 for each \\nfailure to comply with due diligence requirements relating to the ﬁling status and amount of \\ncertain credits with respect to a taxpayer’s return or claim for refund.  \\n \\nProvision: This provision increases the penalty for aiding and abetting the understatement of a \\ntax liability by a COVID employee retention tax credit (ERTC) promoter. The provision makes \\nclear that the pre-enactment standard for applying the aiding and abetting penalty remains \\nunchanged despite the targeted increase in the amount of the penalty that applies solely to \\nERTC promoters. \\n \\nThis section also requires a COVID-ERTC promoter to comply with due diligence requirements \\nwith respect to a taxpayer’s eligibility for (or the amount of) an ERTC and applies a $1,000 \\npenalty for each failure to comply.

Beginning in 2024, if there is a duplicate claim, the IRS will send both claimants a \\nnotice stating that the child’s SSN was used twice. The following year, the IRS will hold refunds \\nuntil October 15 and use its math error authority to correct any duplicative claims by \\neliminating the claimed child and processing the remainder of the claims.

After the \\ninitial two years, this section provides for a pre-certiﬁcation process that will reduce erroneous \\npayments without delaying refunds. \\n \\nThis provision also creates a task force to provide the Secretary of Treasury a report on \\nrecommendations for improvement of the integrity of the administration of the EITC, the \\npotential use of third-party payroll and consumption datasets to verify income, and the \\nintegration of automated databases to allow horizontal veriﬁcation to reduce improper \\npayments, fraud, and abuse.  \\n \\nFinally, this provision provides Purple Heart recipients whose Social Security disability insurance \\nbeneﬁts were terminated due to returning to work with an additional EITC amount equivalent \\nto one year of the lost disability insurance beneﬁts.  \\n \\nSec. 112207.

Termination of tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations.  \\nCurrent Law: Under current law, the IRS generally only issues a letter revoking recognition of an \\norganization’s tax-exempt status after (1) conducting an examination of the organization; (2) \\nissuing a letter to the organization proposing revocation; and (3) allowing the organization to \\nexhaust the administrative appeal rights that follow the issuance of the proposed revocation \\nletter.  \\n \\nProvision: This provision grants the Secretary of the Treasury authority to suspend the tax-\\nexempt status of any tax-exempt organization that, during the three years prior to designation, \\nprovided more than a minor amount of material support or resources to a listed terrorist \\norganization. The provision allows suspensions to be lifted only when the supported terrorist \\norganization is de-listed as a terrorist organization, but the Treasury Department’s ability to \\nsuspend tax-exempt status is subject to a robust set of procedural and due process protections, \\nincluding notice requirements and an opportunity to challenge the designation. \\n \\nSec. 112210.

Termination of deduction for personal exemptions. Current Law: Under current law, the deduction for personal exemptions is set to return after December 31, 2025. Provision: This provision permanently repeals the deduction for personal exemptions. Sec. 110004. Extension of increased child tax credit and temporary enhancement. Current Law: Under current law, the child tax credit will return to pre-2017 levels after December 31, 2025. This means that the credit amount will drop from $2,000 to $1,000 per child, the child Social Security number (SSN) requirement will be eliminated, and fewer American families will qualify for the credit as the income phase-out levels return to much lower thresholds. Additionally, the $500 nonrefundable credit for non-child dependents will expire after December 31, 2025.

Both limitations phase in over a xed range of taxable income ($100,000 for married taxpayers ling jointly and $50,000 for all other taxpayers). Due to the structure of these phase-ins, some taxpayers are subject to marginal tax rates close to 70 percent. The deduction for qualied business income is set to expire for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Provision: This provision makes the deduction for qualied business income permanent.

This change prevents taxpayers from being subject to marginal tax rates close to 70 percent.

This provision also makes certain income of business development companies (as dened in the Investment Company Act of 1940) eligible for the qualied business income deduction. Sec. 110006.

Current Law: Under current law, in tax years beginning after December 21, 2025 certain individual taxpayers will be subject to an overall limitation on itemized deductions known as the Pease limitation. In 2026, the Pease limitation is expected to apply to taxpayers with adjusted gross income above the following thresholds: $339,850 for single lers, $373,850 for head of household lers, and $407,850 for married joint lers.

Treatment of health reimbursement arrangements integrated with individual market coverage. Current Law: Under current law, employees with a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) oered by their employer can use this tax-advantaged arrangement on certain medical expenses. Final regulations from 2019 expanded the use of HRAs, allowing employers to oer Individual Coverage HRAs which, in addition to existing medical expenses, can also now be used to purchase qualied health insurance on the individual market without violating group health plan requirements. Provision: This provision codies the nal 2019 regulations permitting Individual Coverage HRAs and renames the policy as Custom Health Option and Individual Care Expense (CHOICE) arrangements. Sec. 110202. Participants in CHOICE arrangement eligible for purchase of Exchange insurance under cafeteria plan. Current Law: Generally, employers cannot reimburse employees for health plan premiums purchased through an Exchange if any of the premium could be paid through salary reduction. This rule makes it impossible for employers to oer an Individual Coverage HRA while also allowing the same employees to use a cafeteria arrangement to pay for the balance of the plans premium.',\n",
              " '19 Provision: This provision permits employees enrolled in a CHOICE arrangement to use a salary reduction to pay for health plan premiums purchased through an Exchange. Sec. 110203. Employer credit for CHOICE arrangement. Current Law: Not applicable. Provision: This provision creates a two-year tax credit for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees oering coverage through CHOICE arrangements for the rst time.

The current guardrails that apply to individuals that are under 65 and are contributing to HSAs would continue to apply to this population, including a penalty on non-qualied medical expenses purchases. Sec. 110205. Treatment of direct primary care service arrangements. Current Law: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has indicated it views certain direct primary care (DPC) arrangements as a separate and additional form of health insurance coverage, therefore incompatible with HSAs which can only be oered alongside an HDHP . Provision: This provision allows individuals with HDHPs to also enroll in DPC arrangements (and maintain their HSA) and allows HSA funds to be used to pay for DPC services. HSA distributions for DPC services cannot exceed $150 per month for individuals or $300 per month for family arrangements, adjusted annually for ination. Sec. 110206. Allowance of bronze and catastrophic plans in connection with health savings accounts. Current Law: Under current law, some bronze and all catastrophic health insurance plans have maximum out-of-pocket costs that exceed IRS-dened limits for HDHPs disqualifying HSA compatibility. Provision: This provision allows all bronze and catastrophic health insurance plans on the Exchange to be eligible plans for the purpose of making HSA contributions.',\n",
              " '20 Sec. 110207. On-site employee clinics. Current Law: Current law does not allow individuals to contribute to an HSA if they utilize certain discounted health services at a health clinic at their worksite because the IRS views such services as a signicant medical benet, therefore incompatible with HSAs. Provision: This provision allows individuals who utilize discounted health care services at a health clinic at their worksite to contribute to an HSA. Sec. 110208. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, tness, and exercise treated as amounts paid for medical care. Current Law: Sports and tness expenses, such as tness facility membership fees, are not treated as HSA qualied medical expenses. Provision: This provision allows individuals to use their HSA for physical tness memberships and instructional physical activity up to $500 per year for an individual and $1,000 per year for a family with up to one-twelfth of such expenses allowed per month.

Current Law: Under current law, if both spouses are HSA-eligible and age 55 or older, they must open separate HSA accounts to make their respective catch-up contributions (an extra $1,000 annually). Provision: This provision would allow both spouses to deposit their catch-up contributions into one account. Sec. 110210. FSA and HRA terminations or conversions to fund HSAs. Current Law: Under current law, individuals cannot transfer exible spending arrangement (FSA) or health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) balances into an HSA. Provision: This section allows employees, at the employers discretion, to convert FSA and HRA balances into an HSA contribution upon enrolling in an HDHP-HSA. The conversion amount is capped at the annual FSA contribution limit ($3,300 in 2025). Sec. 110211. Special rule for certain medical expenses incurred before establishment of health savings account. Current Law: Under current law, HSA funds can only be used for the purchase of a qualied medical expense (QME) after the HSA is established. Provision: This provision would allow medical services incurred within 60 days before the establishment of an account to be eligible QMEs.',\n",
              " '21 Sec. 110212. Contributions permitted if spouse has health exible spending arrangement. Current Law: Under current law, individuals are not eligible for an HSA if their spouse is enrolled in a exible spending arrangement (FSA).

Such additional amounts are phased out for individuals making $100,000 annually (or $200,000 for families). Sec. 110214. Regulations. Current Law: Not applicable. Provision: This provision allows the Secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services to prescribe rules and guidance as appropriate to enact the policies in this Part. Subtitle B Make Rural America and Main Street Grow Again Part 1 Extension of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Reforms for Rural America and Main Street Sec. 111001. Extension of special depreciation allowance for certain property. Current Law: Under current law, taxpayers are generally required to deduct the cost of property used in a trade or business over a period of time. However, in the case of certain qualied property (including most equipment and machinery), a taxpayer is permitted to deduct a percentage of the cost in the rst year that the property is placed in service (immediate expensing). For qualied property placed in service in 2025, a taxpayer is generally permitted to immediately expense 40 percent of the cost. For qualied property placed in service in 2026, a taxpayer is generally permitted to immediately expense 20 percent of the cost. Provision: This provision allows taxpayers to immediately expense 100 percent of the cost of qualied property acquired on or after January 20, 2025, and before January 1, 2030. Sec. 111002. Deduction of domestic research and experimental expenditures. Current Law: Under current law, taxpayers are required to deduct research or experimental expenditures over a ve-year period. Research or experimental expenditures that are attributable to research conducted outside the U.S. are required to be deducted over a 15-year period.',\n",
              " '22 Provision: This provision allows taxpayers to immediately deduct domestic research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030. This provision includes rules to coordinate the immediate deductibility of domestic research or experimental expenditures with the research credit, rules clarifying the treatment of foreign research or experimental expenditures, and other coordinating changes. Sec. 111003. Modied calculation of adjusted taxable income for purposes of business interest deduction. Current Law: Under current law, the deduction for business interest expense for a taxable year is generally limited to the sum of (1) the taxpayers business interest income for the taxable year, (2) 30 percent of the taxpayers \"adjusted taxable income for the taxable year, and (3) the taxpayers oor plan nancing interest for the taxable year. Adjusted taxable income corresponds with the nancial accounting concept of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Floor plan nancing interest refers to interest paid or accrued on indebtedness used to nance the acquisition of motor vehicles held for sale or lease to retail customers and secured by the inventory so acquired. A motor vehicle means a motor vehicle that is: (1) any selfpropelled vehicle designed for transporting person or property on a public street, highway, or road; (2) a boat; or (3) farm machinery or equipment. Provision: This provision increases the cap on the deductibility of business interest expense for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030. Specically, it provides that adjusted taxable income is computed without taking into account deductions for depreciation, amortization, or depletion. As a result, adjusted taxable income corresponds with the nancial accounting concept of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). This provision also permanently modies the denition of motor vehicle to include certain trailers and campers designed to be towed by or axed to a motor vehicle. This change allows interest on oor plan nancing for such trailers and campers to be deducted. Sec. 111004. Extension of deduction for foreign-derived intangible income and global intangible low-taxed income. Current Law: Under current law, a U.S. corporation is allowed a deduction of 37.5 percent for its foreign-derived intangible income and a 50 percent deduction for its inclusions with respect to global intangible low-taxed income. These deductions will be reduced to 21.875 percent and 37.5 percent, respectively, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Provision: This provision permanently increases the deduction amount for foreign-derived intangible income from 21.875 percent to 37.5 percent and increases the deduction for global',\n",
              " '23 intangible low-taxed income from 37.5 percent to 50 percent for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Sec. 111005. Extension of base erosion minimum tax amount. Current Law: Under current law, the base erosion anti-abuse tax imposes a 10 percent minimum tax on corporations with annual gross receipts in excess of $500 million and base erosion payments above a certain threshold. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the 10 percent rate will increase to 12.5 percent and credits computing the tax will no longer be allowed. Provision: This provision permanently reduces the rate from 12.5 percent to 10 percent beginning January 1, 2026. The provision also permanently retains the current treatment of tax credits for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. Part 2 Additional Tax Relief for Rural America and Main Street Sec. 111101. Special depreciation allowance for qualied production property. Current Law: Under current law, taxpayers are generally required to deduct the cost of nonresidential real property over a 39-year period. Provision: This provision allows taxpayers to immediately deduct 100 percent of the cost of certain new factories, certain improvements to existing factories, and certain other structures. Specically, this provision allows taxpayers to deduct 100 percent of the adjusted basis of qualied production property in the year such property is placed in service. Qualied production property is dened as the portion of any nonresidential real property that meets the following requirements (among others): 1. The property must be used by the taxpayer as an integral part of a qualied production activity; 2. The property must be placed in service in the U.S. or a U.S. territory; 3. The original use of the property must begin with the taxpayer; 4. The construction of the property must begin after December 31, 2024, and before January 1, 2030; 5. The property must be placed in service before January 1, 2034; and 6. The taxpayer must have elected to claim an immediate deduction with respect to such portion of the property. A qualied production activity generally means the manufacturing, production, or rening of tangible personal property. An activity generally does not count as a qualied production activity unless it results in a substantial transformation of the property comprising a product. The term production is limited to agricultural production and chemical production.',\n",
              " '24 Some of the requirements described above are relaxed in the case of a taxpayer that acquires a property that was not used for productive activities during the period between January 1, 2021, and May 12, 2025. This special rule could apply, for instance, to a taxpayer that acquires and rehabilitates a factory that was abandoned in 2020. Any portion of a property that is used for oces, administrative services, lodging, parking, sales activities, research activities, software engineering activities, or certain other functions is ineligible for this benet. Recapture rules apply in certain cases where, during the 10-year period after qualied production property is placed in service, the use of the property changes. Sec. 111102. Renewal and enhancement of opportunity zones. Current Law: Under current law, opportunity zones (OZs) exist as a temporary policy that have been used as an economic development tool to revitalize distressed communities across the country. Created in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, OZs are census tracts that meet the denition of low-income community and that were nominated by state governors and certied by the U.S. Department of Treasury as eligible areas for qualied investments to be made in exchange for certain tax benets. The program was created as temporary policy, existing over a 10-year window as an initial round of OZ development. Denitions Low-Income Community (LIC): A census tract that has a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income that does not exceed 80 percent of the area median income. Qualied Opportunity Fund (QOF): An investment vehicle with the specic purpose of investing in OZs. All qualifying investments must be made through QOFs in order to be eligible for the tax benets. Designation In each state, governors were able to nominate up to 25 percent of eligible tracts as OZs. If a state had less than 100 eligible tracts, then up to 25 eligible tracts were allowed to be designated. Additionally, under certain circumstances, a contiguous tract that is not a LIC was able to be designated along with the LIC that was designated as an OZ. Tax Benets The OZ program operates over a 10-year window and provides investors with three tax benets for investing their unrealized capital gains into eligible distressed communities: 1. A temporary deferral on taxes for capital gains rolled over from a non-OZ investment into a QOF to be invested into an OZ. The taxes are not realized until 2026 or when the asset is sold/disposed of, whichever comes rst.',\n",
              " '25 2. A step-up in basis on their previously earned capital gains that were invested in a QOF. Investments held for ve years receive a 10 percent step-up in basis and investments held for seven years receive an additional ve percent step-up in basis (for a total 15 percent). 3. For investments held for at least 10 years, taxpayers receive a permanent exclusion of taxable income on the gains resulting from the original investment. The initial OZ round is set to expire after December 31, 2026. Provision: This provision creates a second round of OZs, making adjustments and improvements to the previous policy. Specically, the denition of low-income community is narrowed to census tracts that have a poverty rate of at least 20 percent or a median family income that does not exceed 70 percent of the area median income. Additionally, a guardrail is added to ensure that the term low-income community does not include any census tract where the median family income is 125 percent or greater of the area median family income. This provision maintains the OZ designation process from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and adds that at least 33 percent of designated OZs must be comprised entirely of a rural area. In the case that there are fewer than 33 percent of rural qualied OZs, all eligible rural areas must be designated. A rural area is dened in the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Additionally, this provision makes contiguous tracts ineligible for OZ designation. Furthermore, this provision simplies the investment incentives and creates rural qualied opportunity funds (RQOFs). Investments made in a QOF receive a single step-up in basis of 10 percent when held for at least ve years. In rural areas, investments must be made into a RQOF and will receive a 30 percent step-up in basis when held for at least ve years. Additionally, taxpayers may choose to invest up to $10,000 of post-tax ordinary income into a QOF or RQOF, and a special rule is created that lowers the substantial improvement threshold of existing structures from 100 percent to 50 percent in rural areas. Lastly, this provision adds reporting requirements for the OZ program. This second round of OZs will begin on January 1, 2027, and end on December 31, 2033. Sec. 111103. Increased dollar limitations for expensing of certain depreciable business assets. Current Law: Under current law (IRC section 179) a taxpayer may elect to expense the cost of qualifying property, rather than to recover such costs through tax depreciation deductions, subject to limitation. Under current law, the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense is $1 million of the cost of qualifying property placed in service for the taxable year. The $1 million amount is reduced by the amount by which the cost of such property placed in service during the taxable year exceeds $2.5 million. The $1 million and $2.5 million amounts are adjusted for ination for taxable years beginning after 2018, and are $1.25 million and $3.13 million in 2025, respectively. In general, qualifying property is dened as depreciable tangible personal property,',\n",
              " '26 o-the-shelf computer software, and qualied real property that is purchased for use in the active conduct of a trade or business. Provision: This provision increases the maximum amount a taxpayer may expense under IRC section 179 to $2.5 million, reduced by the amount by which the cost of qualifying property exceeds $4 million. The $2.5 million and $4 million amounts are adjusted for ination for taxable years beginning after 2025. The proposal applies to property placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Sec. 111104. Repeal of revision to de minimis rules for third party network transactions. Current Law: Under current law, third-party settlement organizations issue Form 1099-K to participating payees receiving gross payments exceeding $600 for goods or services, regardless of the number of transactions. A third-party settlement organization is the central organization that has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees (generally, a merchant or business) in a third-party payment network. The change in reporting thresholds was supposed to take eect following the American Rescue Plan of 2021 (ARPA). However, due to delays in implementation, for the 2024 tax year, third-party settlement organizations must issue a Form 1099-K for payees receiving gross payments exceeding $5,000 for goods or services, regardless of the number of transactions. This threshold decreases to $2,500 for 2025 and is set to drop to $600 for 2026 and beyond, as originally mandated by ARPA, though the IRS has repeatedly delayed full implementation. Provision: This provision modies requirements for third-party settlement organizations to eliminate their reporting requirement with respect to the transactions of their participating payees unless they have earned more than $20,000 on more than 200 separate transactions in an applicable tax period. This reverses the ARPA provision that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions. Sec. 111105. Increase in threshold for requiring information reporting with respect to certain payees. Current Law: Under current law, the reporting threshold for payments by a business for services performed by an independent contractor or subcontractor and for certain other payments is generally $600. In some cases, the reporting threshold is based on payments made during the taxable year. Provision: This provision generally increases the threshold to $2,000 and adjusts it for ination for taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024. The new threshold is based on payments during the calendar year. This provision applies to payments made after December 31, 2024. Sec. 111106. Repeal of excise tax on indoor tanning services. Current Law: Under current law, there is a 10 percent excise tax on amounts paid for indoor tanning services. Indoor tanning services include any services employing any electronic product designed to incorporate one or more ultraviolet lamps, intended for irradiation of an individual by ultraviolet radiation (wavelengths between 200 and 400 nanometers) to induce skin tanning.',\n",
              " '27 Provision: This provision repeals the excise tax on indoor tanning services eective on the date of enactment. Sec. 111107. Exclusion of interest on loans secured by rural or agricultural real property. Current Law: Not applicable. Provision: This provision allows for a partial exclusion of interest on certain loans secured by rural or agricultural real estate. Specically, it allows for the exclusion of 25 percent of interest received by a qualied lender on any qualied real estate loan. A qualied lender means (1) any bank or savings association the deposits of which are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, (2) any state- or federally-regulated insurance company, (3) certain U.S. bank subsidiaries, (4) certain U.S. insurance subsidiaries, and (5) with respect to certain loans, any federally chartered instrumentality of the U.S. established under Section 8.1(a) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971. A qualied real estate loan means any loan that meets the following requirements: (1) the loan is secured by rural or agricultural real estate, or by a leasehold mortgage (with a status as a lien) on rural or agricultural real estate, (2) the loan is not made to certain foreign entities of concern, and (3) the loan is made after the date of enactment and before January 1, 2029. Rural or agricultural real estate means (1) any real property which is substantially used for the production of one or more agricultural products, (2) any real property which is substantially used in the trade or business of shing or seafood processing, or (3) certain aquaculture facilities. This term does not include any property not located in the U.S. or a U.S. territory. Sec. 111108. Treatment of certain qualied sound recording productions. Current Law: Under current law, under IRC section 168(k), taxpayers are generally permitted to expense a percentage of qualied property in the taxable year that the property is placed in service. Additionally, under IRC section 181, taxpayers are permitted to expense the certain costs of lm, television, and live theatrical productions in the taxable year such costs are incurred, in the case of productions commencing before January 1, 2026. Provision: This provision will increase taxpayers ability to expense certain costs of producing sound recordings. Specically, it would make qualied sound recording productions placed in service before January 1, 2029, eligible for expensing under IRC section 168(k). It would also allow taxpayers to expense up to $150,000 (per taxable year) of costs of qualied sound recording productions under IRC section 181. A qualied sound recording production is a sound recording produced and recorded in the U.S. Sec. 111109. Modications to low-income housing credit. Current Law: Under current law, to receive the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), a building must either receive a credit allocation from the state housing nance authority or be',\n",
              " '28 bond-nanced. For the credit, Congress sets the per capita allocation amount on a yearly basis. For 2023, each state received a $2.75 per capita allocation. For projects that are bond-nanced, at least 50 percent of the aggregate basis of the building and land must be nanced with bonds that are subject to a states private activity bond volume cap. Additionally, projects can receive a basis boost if they are in Dicult Development Areas (DDAs). Generally, DDAs are areas with poverty rates of 25 percent or more or where 50 percent of households have incomes below 60 percent of the area median income. Provision: This provision makes three changes to the LIHTC program. First, for calendar years 2026 through 2029, the 9% LIHTC is restored to its 2021 level with a 12.5 percent allocation increase. Second, for the 4% LIHTC, this provision lowers the bond-nancing threshold to 25 percent for projects nanced by bonds with an issue date before 2030. Last, this provision designates Indian and rural areas as DDAs. Sec. 111110. Increased gross receipts threshold for small manufacturing businesses. Current Law: Under current law, in general, taxpayers with average annual gross receipts below $25 million (over the prior three taxable years) are permitted to use the cash method of accounting, are exempt from the cap on business interest deductibility, are exempt from the requirement to account for inventories, and are exempt from certain capitalization rules. The $25 million threshold is indexed for ination and, in 2025, is $31 million. Provision: This provision increases the gross receipts threshold described above for manufacturing taxpayers from $25 million to $80 million. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. The $80 million threshold is indexed for ination and, in 2026, will be approximately $100 million. To qualify as a manufacturing taxpayer a business generally must derive substantially all of its gross receipts (over the prior three taxable years) from the lease, rental, license, sale, exchange, or other disposition of tangible personal property produced or manufactured by the business. Sec. 111111. Global intangible low-taxed income determined without regard to certain income derived from services performed in the Virgin Islands. Current Law: The global intangible low tax income of U.S. shareholders is included in the income of U.S. persons in the years it is earned. That is the income in excess of a 10 percent deemed income return on qualied businesses assets. Corporations are then allowed a 50 percent GILTI deduction so that active income earned oshore is subject to a minimum rate of tax between 10.5 percent and 13.125 percent. A corporation that is organized in a territory is generally treated as a foreign corporation for federal tax purposes. Provision: This provision would exempt certain income earned in the U.S. Virgin Islands from being considered tested income for the purposes of certain individuals GILTI calculations.',\n",

Current Law: Under current law, taxpayers may claim a credit for the production of transportation fuel, including aviation fuel, to the extent it meets certain greenhouse gas emission standards. The value of the credit is an applicable amount per gallon multiplied by an emissions factor. The applicable amounts are $0.20 per gallon for transportation fuel that is not sustainable aviation fuel (nonaviation fuel) and $0.35 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel, multiplied by ve if the taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions.

              " '42 Part 2 Removing Taxpayer Benets for Illegal Immigrants Sec. 112101. Permitting premium tax credit only for certain individuals. Current Law: Current law allows individuals who are lawfully present in the U.S. to receive premium tax credits to purchase health insurance on the Exchange. Lawful presence is dened through rulemaking to include most immigration statuses. Provision: This provision would eliminate premium tax credit eligibility for illegal immigrants and only allow eligibility for Lawful Permanent Residents, certain Cuban immigrants, and individuals living in the United States through a Compact of Free Association. Sec. 112102. Certain aliens treated as ineligible for premium tax credit. Current Law: Current law allows individuals who are lawfully present in the U.S. to receive premium tax credits to purchase health insurance on the Exchange.

The provision also creates an exception for remittance transfers that are sent by veried U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals by way of qualied remittance transfer providers. Qualied remittance transfer providers are dened as remittance transfer providers that enter into a written agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury to verify the remittance transfer senders as U.S. citizens or U.S. nationals. The provision also provides a refundable tax credit for any excise taxes required to be paid by taxpayers with valid Social Security numbers. Lastly, the provision also has an anti-conduit rule. Sec. 112106. Social Security number requirement for American opportunity and lifetime learning credits.

Enforcement provisions with respect to COVID-related employee retention credits. Current Law: Under current law, assessable penalties are imposed on promoters of tax shelters or abusive transactions. One such penalty is based on aiding and abetting the understatement of tax liability, if the person knows that an understatement of the tax liability of another person would result. Separately, paid tax return preparers are subject to a penalty of $500 for each failure to comply with due diligence requirements relating to the ling status and amount of certain credits with respect to a taxpayers return or claim for refund. Provision: This provision increases the penalty for aiding and abetting the understatement of a tax liability by a COVID employee retention tax credit (ERTC) promoter. The provision makes clear that the pre-enactment standard for applying the aiding and abetting penalty remains unchanged despite the targeted increase in the amount of the penalty that applies solely to ERTC promoters. This section also requires a COVID-ERTC promoter to comply with due diligence requirements with respect to a taxpayers eligibility for (or the amount of) an ERTC and applies a $1,000 penalty for each failure to comply. Under current law, taxpayers can claim COVID-related ERTC until April 15, 2025. This section bars the IRS from issuing any additional unpaid claims, unless a claim for such credit or refund was led on or before January 31, 2024. Sec. 112206. Earned income tax credit reforms. Current Law: Under current law, a taxpayer can qualify for the earned income tax credit (EITC) if they (1) have earned income, (2) have a valid Social Security number (SSN), (3) be a U.S. citizen or resident alien all year, (4) not le Form 2555, (5) meet income and investment limits, and (6) le as single, head of household, qualifying surviving spouse, or married ling jointly. The IRS may audit an EITC claim or deny all or part of the credit if there are errors on a tax return. The',\n",
              " '45 most common error taxpayers claim is (1) that the child does not qualify, (2) more than one person claimed the child, (3) the SSN or last names do not match, (4) the taxpayer is married but led as single head of household, and (5) over or underreporting income or expenses. Consequently, the IRS issues duplicative claims and the EITC has a high rate of improper payments. Provision: This provision establishes a phased system for the IRS to detect and manage duplicate EITC claims. Beginning in 2024, if there is a duplicate claim, the IRS will send both claimants a notice stating that the childs SSN was used twice. The following year, the IRS will hold refunds until October 15 and use its math error authority to correct any duplicative claims by eliminating the claimed child and processing the remainder of the claims. Claimants can obtain a refund if they respond to the math error notice and provide evidence of eligibility. After the initial two years, this section provides for a pre-certication process that will reduce erroneous payments without delaying refunds. This provision also creates a task force to provide the Secretary of Treasury a report on recommendations for improvement of the integrity of the administration of the EITC, the potential use of third-party payroll and consumption datasets to verify income, and the integration of automated databases to allow horizontal verication to reduce improper payments, fraud, and abuse. Finally, this provision provides Purple Heart recipients whose Social Security disability insurance benets were terminated due to returning to work with an additional EITC amount equivalent to one year of the lost disability insurance benets.

Provision: This provision terminates the current Direct File program at the IRS and establishes a public-private partnership between the IRS and private sector tax preparation services to oer free tax ling, replacing both the existing Direct File and Free File programs. Sec. 112208. Postponement of tax deadlines for hostages and individuals wrongfully detained abroad. Current Law: Under current law, neither the provision on service in a combat zone nor the rules on disaster relief address persons who fail to meet a tax ling or payment deadline that arises while they are unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad. Provision: This provision directs the IRS to disregard the time during which an applicable individual is held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad for purposes of determining whether a taxpayer led their return, paid income tax, led a claim for a credit or refund of any tax, or',\n",
              " '46 committed other acts described in Section 7508(a)(1) within the required timeframe, and for purposes of determining the amount of interest or penalty owed, or amount of any credit or refund. Additionally, this section requires the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a program to allow any applicable individual to apply for a refund or abatement of any amount to the extent such amount was attributable to the time during which the taxpayer was held hostage or unlawfully detained abroad. Sec. 112209. Termination of tax-exempt status of terrorist supporting organizations. Current Law: Under current law, the IRS generally only issues a letter revoking recognition of an organizations tax-exempt status after (1) conducting an examination of the organization; (2) issuing a letter to the organization proposing revocation; and (3) allowing the organization to exhaust the administrative appeal rights that follow the issuance of the proposed revocation letter. Provision: This provision grants the Secretary of the Treasury authority to suspend the taxexempt status of any tax-exempt organization that, during the three years prior to designation, provided more than a minor amount of material support or resources to a listed terrorist organization. The provision allows suspensions to be lifted only when the supported terrorist organization is de-listed as a terrorist organization, but the Treasury Departments ability to suspend tax-exempt status is subject to a robust set of procedural and due process protections, including notice requirements and an opportunity to challenge the designation. Sec. 112210. Increase in penalties for unauthorized disclosures of taxpayer information. Current Law: Under current law, the maximum ne for unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer information is $5,000. The maximum term of imprisonment upon conviction of a Section 7213 violation is ve years. Additionally, under current law, a willful unauthorized disclosure involving the returns or return information of multiple taxpayers is unclear. Provision: This provision increases the specied maximum ne in IRC section 7513 to $250,000 and the maximum term of imprisonment to 10 years. This section also claries that a separate violation occurs with respect to each such taxpayer whose return or return information is disclosed, upon the willful unauthorized disclosure involving the returns or return information of multiple taxpayers. Sec. 112211. Restriction on regulation of contingency fees with respect to tax returns, etc. Current Law: Not applicable. Provision: This provision restricts the Treasury Department from regulating, prohibiting, or restricting the use of contingency fees in connection with tax returns, refunds, or documentation with tax returns for refunds prepared on behalf of taxpayers.
